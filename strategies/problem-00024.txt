Start with the smallest possible digit (zero in this case), then find the
number of permutations of the remaining digits.  If this number is less than
1000000, then zero cannot be the first digit in the 1000000th permutation.

Try one instead, and count the number of permutations.  Keep going with two,
three, four, etc until the number of permutations exceeds 1000000.  Suppose
that fixing the first digit at k results in more than 1000000 permutations;
this means the first digit is fixed at k-1, and the second digit must be
examined by this method.

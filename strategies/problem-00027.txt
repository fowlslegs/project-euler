The restriction that f(0) is a prime immediately constrains b to be a prime.
Furthermore, f(b) is definitely NOT a prime, as:

f(b) = b*b + a*b + b 
     = b*(b + a + 1)

When considering a polynomial, then, 0 <= n <= b, -1000 < a < 1000, and b must
be prime.  We know that for values of b ~= 1601, only 80 consecutive primes are
produced, so the search space is already thinning with this very naive analysis.
Further analysis could probably tighten the bounds on a, but with just these
bounds, a solution can be found in under 10 seconds.

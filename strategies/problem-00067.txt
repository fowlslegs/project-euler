Consider this smaller problem:

   1
  2 3
 4 5 6              

Once you arrive at element 2, you will only ever want to move to number 5, and
never 4.  Thus, the triangle can be reduced to this:

   1
  7 3
   5 6

Similarly, when you arrive at 3, you will only ever want to move to 6, so this
is the new reduction:

   1
  7 9

So lastly, when you reach element 1, you will only ever want to move to 9, giving
max sum to be 10.

This is the strategy employed to solve this problem.

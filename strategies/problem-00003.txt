[Fermat's Factorizatoin Algorithm]
Fermat's factorization algorithm tries to express the number being factored, n,
as the difference of two squares:

n^2 = a^2 - b^2

If this is possible, n can be factored like so:

n = (a+b)(a-b)

[Monte Carlo Method]
Pollard's Rho factorization method (or the Monte Carlo method) works well for
large odd numbers with small factors.  It works like this:
1. First choose random integers x0 and a (with a != 0, 2) and a Diophantine
   polynomial such as f(x) = x^2 + a
2. Generate a sequence of x[k] using x[k+1] = f(x[k]) mod n
3. If d is small compared to n, and d|n, then eventually the x[k]'s become
   periodic.  That is, x[i] = x[j] mod d.
4. The choice of x0 and f(x) should be such that x[i] = x[j] mod d, but
   x[i] != x[j] mod n.  If this is the case, d divides x[j] - x[i] but n does
   not.  Hence gcd(x[j]-x[i], n) is a divisor of n.

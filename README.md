DESCRIPTION

These are solutions to Project Euler problems.  It's easy to find solutions on the
net, so if you don't want to spoil the fun, don't look at these.

Feel free to do WHATEVER with the code; I've added a license so anybody can go wild
with it.

The Clojure solutions require <http://www.github.com/retiman/clj-pelib> to be
present in the classpath.

Check which solutions have been provided by running:
